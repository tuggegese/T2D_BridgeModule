# T2D_BridgeModule
## Description
T2D_BridgeModule was developed for the open source hydrodynamic solver TELEMAC-2D ([TELEMAC-MASCRET](http://www.opentelemac.org/)). The bridge module considers the effect of the bridges on the flow by computing simplified 1D head losses and adding them as an additional source of momentum in the shallow water equation. The following publication was used as a starting point for developing the module:

<em> Ratia, H., Murillo, J., & García‐Navarro, P. (2014). Numerical modelling of bridges in 2D shallow water flow simulations. International Journal for Numerical methods in fluids, 75(4), 250-272. </em>

Further details on the implementation can be found in the added paper (will be added soon).

## Installation

First make sure to be familier with the basic installation of the TELEMAC-MASCARET environment. Instructions for your OS can be found on the homepage ([TELEMAC-MASCRET](http://www.opentelemac.org/)).
